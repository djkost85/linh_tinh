FAQs:

What is debug mode ?
After recieving numerous cURL and PHP related problems, we decided to add the debug mode. This mode is still in development but at the moment it will tell u
1) If cURL is enabled or not
2) What is your PHP Version (5+ is recommended but not obligatory)
3) It will display your php info

How to access debug mode ?
You will need to change $debug = 0; to $debug = 1;
Then you need to enter ?debug at the end of your Linkchecker URL and click on check links. At the end change debug=1 to anything else or anyone will be able to access your php info.
Example URL (for example if your link checker is situated at http://www.yourdomain.com/lc/lc.php) then you run:
http://www.yourdomain.com/lc/lc.php?debug

What if i dont have cURL installed?
You can change $fgc = 0 to $fgc = 1 which will enable function file_get_contents and disable cURL. Alternatively you can install cURL at http://php.net/cURL
